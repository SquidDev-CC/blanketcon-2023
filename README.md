# BlanketCon 2023 Scripts
Various scripts written for the CC:T booth at [BlanketCon 2023].

Please note that many of these programs were hacked together (or at least
heavily modified) specifically for the con to quite a tight deadline. The code
quality is not the best, and they'll probably require a lot of modification to
make them work.

## Interesting projects
 - `src/piano`: A piano using Create's steam pipes.
 - `src/player-scanner` (and `blanketcon_2023`): Draws the nearby player's skin
   to a monitor, and whether they're wearing wearing a neural interface or not.
 - `src/tour`: Overlay glasses powered tour through the booth.
 - `src/tree-farm`/`src/tree-farm-monitor`: A basic tree farm using Plethora
   block scanners and lasers

## Support projects
 - `src/no-terminate`: Wrapper script which prevents a user terminating the
    computer.
